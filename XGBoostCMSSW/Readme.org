* XGBoostCMSSW
  This package provides an interface to XGBoost through the its c_api. To install the package follow the standard CMSSW guidelines and
  the additional steps below.

** Setup the package
   =cmsrel X_Y_Z=

   =cd X_Y_Z/src=

   =cmsenv=

   =git cms-init=

   =git clone https://github.com/simonepigazzini/XGBoostCMSSW.git=

   =cp XGBoostCMSSW/XGBoostInterface/toolbox/*xml $CMSSW_BASE/config/toolbox/$SCRAM_ARCH/tools/selected/=

   =scram setup rabit=
   
   =scram setup xgboost=

   =scram b -j=

   The last two steps should print out a confirmation that the relevant libraries have been succesfully loaded as CMSSW external tools.

** Use the package
   - The package is now setup to be used as any other CMSSW package, see https://github.com/simonepigazzini/PrecisionTiming/blob/TDR/FTLAnalysis/src/TrackPUIDMVA.cc
     for an example (MVAComputer is a similar class for TMVA, the usage is identical to XGBComputer).
   - The file from which the model is loaded should be generated by the =xgboost.Booster.get_dump()= (https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html).
     Note that if you use the XGBoostRegressor or XGBoostClassifier classes you must get the dumper first, so: =xgboost.XGBoostClassifier.get_booster().get_dump()=.

** Run within cmsRun job 
   The libxgboost.so file is too large to be handle by dlopen (running a cmsRun job using this package will ends up in an error message).
   You should set the =LD_PRELOAD= with the command provided below before executing the cmsRun command:
   - BASH:
     =export LD_PRELOAD=$CMSSW_BASE/external/$SCRAM_ARCH/lib/libxgboost.so=
   - FISH:
     =set -x LD_PRELOAD $CMSSW_BASE/external/$SCRAM_ARCH/lib/libxgboost.so=
